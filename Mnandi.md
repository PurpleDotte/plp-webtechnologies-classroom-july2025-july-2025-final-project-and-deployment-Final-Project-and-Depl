# Mnandi TakeAways Website

## The site is live at: https://purpledotte.github.io/plp-webtechnologies-classroom-july2025-july-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Final-Project-and-Depl/

## 👋 About This Project

This is a simple food ordering website I built for a fictional food business called **Mnandi TakeAways**. The idea is to showcase a local takeaway's menu, allow people to sign up for updates or deals, and also provide basic contact details.

I wanted to make it feel like a modern, homegrown online food place that’s easy to use and nice to look at.

## 🧱 Tech Used

- **HTML** – for the structure
- **CSS** – for all the styling (I used some basic layout tricks and effects)
- **JavaScript** – for the page switching, form validation, and dynamic menu loading

## 📁 File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML page with all the content (home, menu, contact, and signup form).
- `style.css` - Styles for layout, fonts, colors, and responsiveness.
- `script.js` - Contains all the interactivity (form validation, image slider, page navigation).
- `/images` - Folder where all images are stored (e.g. food pictures, background, etc.)

## 🌐 Features

### 1. Multi-Page Navigation *(Without Reloading)*
Clicking **Home**, **Menu**, or **Contact** switches views without loading a new page. It's done using simple JS functions that hide/show sections.

### 2. **Image Slider**
There's a rotating image slider on the homepage that cycles through some food pics every 5 seconds.

### 3. **Sign-Up Form**
Visitors can fill in a form to "sign up" (just a demo for now). The form checks if passwords match before submitting.

### 4. **Dynamic Menu List**
The menu section loads items from a JavaScript array. Each menu item comes with a little thumbnail image and a description with a price.

### 5. **Terms & Privacy Modals**
If users click the "Terms of Use" or "Privacy Policy" links, instead of navigating away, a pop-up modal opens with the full content. I made the modal appear with some dark overlay for better readability.

## 🔒 Validation

- Passwords must match.
- All input fields are required.
- Checkbox must be ticked before submitting.

## 🎨 Design Choices

- **Colors**: I went for warm colors like coral, brown and orange, since it fits the food/takeaway vibe.
- **Fonts**: Simple and readable.
- **Background**: Added a food table image with a dark overlay to keep the text readable.
- **Responsive-ish**: The layout is not fully responsive for mobile yet, but looks good on desktop or tablet screens.

## 🚧 Things I Still Want To Add

- Make the site mobile-friendly (responsive).
- Connect the form to a backend (maybe Firebase or PHP) so I can store signups.
- Add a real cart and ordering system.
- Include Google Maps integration for location.

---

## 📝 How to Run

Just open the `index.html` file in any browser. Make sure the images folder is in the right place so everything loads properly.

No servers or frameworks needed — it's all plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Made This

This was for practice — I wanted to build something from scratch that combined layout, form validation, modals, sliders, and dynamic content. I also tried to make the code as readable and organized as I could.

## 📸 Preview

Here’s a little idea of what it looks like:

- ✅ Home page with image slider
- ✅ Menu with pictures of meals
- ✅ Contact info and working hours
- ✅ Sign-up form with validation
- ✅ Smooth switching between pages
